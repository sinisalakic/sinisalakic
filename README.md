## Hi there 👋

**sinisalakic/sinisalakic** - an associate professor in research methods in psychology (UNIBL, Republic of Srpska / Bosnia & Herzegovina) - teaching stats, research methods, psychometrics, academic skills.

📚 Currently writing what seems to be the first book in the BCS language integrating R code with quantitative reasoning on data (within bookdown). Better late than never :)

🌱 My Main Professional Interests Include:

- Education: Experienced in many topics from evaluating structural issues to constructing educational tests and promoting self-regulated learning practices.
- Psychological Assessment: Interested in typological versus dimensional approach dilemmas on a range of issues (e.g. from social identities to burnout).
- Academic Integrity: Unpacking the psychological facets that influence honesty and integrity in academia.

🚀 A lifelong learner who’s still striving to crack the code on reproducible research and serious R programming...
